## PUBLIC

**We have hosted the app locally, and you can access it [here](https://sparkchallenge-nextjs-frontend-583938538589.us-central1.run.app/)**

## HOSTING LOCALLY

**We have written a `docker-compose` file to help hosting the app locally easier**

**Make sure to have the Docker engine running**

**Email dvle3@asu.edu or dnguye92@asu.edu for credentials.json file and .env**

Just run `docker-compose up --build` at the root folder, then access `localhost:3000` after the build has finished
